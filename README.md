# Digital Logic Design Project - A.Y. 2019-2020
The project consisted in designing a hardware component, based on the working-zone encoding (WZE) for reducing the energy in microprocessor address buses and to describe it in VHDL, hence to synthesize it.

# Documentation

The documentation (available only in Italian) includes:
* specifications of the project [specs](https://github.com/arigalzi/WorkingZone-encoding/tree/main/specifications)
* a description of the architecture of the component [docs](https://github.com/arigalzi/WorkingZone-encoding/blob/main/documentation/doc.pdf)
* the design choices that were made 
* the experimental results, obtained syntethizing the component
* the analysis of several simulations on corner cases through the use of [testbenches](https://github.com/arigalzi/WorkingZone-encoding/tree/main/test_benches), that show the correcteness and the performances of the component
* some possible improvements
